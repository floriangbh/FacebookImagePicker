Like this :

```xml

<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
        <string>Editor</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
            <array>
                <string>fb<YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID></string>
            </array>
    </dict>
</array>
<key>FacebookAppID</key>
<string><YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID></string>
```

Just in case, for public application (which can be use in the AppStore), you need to send your Facebook's App in review to have user's photos permission.
